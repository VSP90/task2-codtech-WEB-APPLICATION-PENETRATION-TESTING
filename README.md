# Web Application Penetration Testing

This repository documents the process and findings of performing penetration testing on a web application to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms.

## Description

Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) is a crucial practice in cybersecurity aimed at identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities within web applications. This repository includes detailed reports, methodologies, and examples of common vulnerabilities found during the testing process.

### Key Areas of Testing

1. **SQL Injection**: Techniques and findings related to injecting malicious SQL commands to manipulate a database.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Methods to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.
3. **Insecure Authentication**: Identifying flaws in authentication mechanisms that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

## Importance

Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks due to their accessibility and the sensitive data they handle. Penetration testing helps in:
- **Identifying Weaknesses**: Uncovering security gaps before malicious actors can exploit them.
- **Mitigating Risks**: Providing actionable recommendations to enhance security.
- **Ensuring Compliance**: Meeting industry standards and regulations.
- **Protecting Data**: Safeguarding sensitive information from breaches.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of web technologies and cybersecurity principles.
- Tools used in this project:
  - SQLMap for SQL Injection
  - OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for general vulnerability scanning
  - Browser Developer Tools for manual testing

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-application-penetration-testing.git
    cd web-application-penetration-testing
    ```

2. **Explore Findings**:
    - Navigate to the `findings/` directory to review detailed reports on each vulnerability type.
    - The `reports/` directory contains a final report and a detailed methodology used during the testing process.

## Example

### SQL Injection Example

```markdown
#### Vulnerability Description
SQL Injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database.

#### Exploitation
1. **Identify Input Fields**: Locate user inputs that interact with the database.
2. **Injection**: Inject SQL payloads such as `' OR '1'='1'; --` into the input fields.
3. **Analyze Response**: Observe the application's response to identify successful exploitation.

#### Mitigation
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
